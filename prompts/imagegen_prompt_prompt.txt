I'm going to give you some passages of text for an adventure game. If the text doesn't make sense to show a picture for (e.g. just a single word, or a short phrase with no visual description), just say 'skip'. Otherwise, give me a prompt I can use with the image generation model to get a picture for it. Make sure the prompt will generate a picture that passes content moderation.
